												DevOps Essentials (CLoudGuru)
=====================================================================================================================================================

Dev = Development team | Ops = Operations
DevOps is a culture of colaboration between the teamstounify software develoipment and operations. It is a group of best practices, not a standard.
It grew from Agile, that serves to develop software in small increments and have frequent cycles. The main goals of DevOps is to delivery/colaborate
on botm teams goals (speed/stability). Main goals: Fast-time-to-market; Few production fails; Immediate recovery from fails(rollbacks);

 -----------      ------      ------------
 | DEVELOPER | + |  QA  | +  | OPERATIONS |		BUILD   >   INTEGRATE   >   TEST   >   DEPLOY
 -----------      ------      ------------
  
- Developers write the code, commit trioggers, auto build integration and tests
- QA gets the code nearly immediately
- Once ready, auto deployment kicks in to production
- When code fails, automatic monitoring soft. notifies them; Rollback is deployed to previous version
+ Automation: Easier to deploy and keep stability | More consistency, building, testing
+ Deployment: More frequent and fast time-to-market

BUILD INOVATION
- Automation: Automatic process of preparing code for deployment to live environment
- Code needs to be compuled, linted, modified, transform, test, etc
	- Automation is independent of IDE(Integrated developement environment)
	- Agnostic of other machines configuration and code can run on other machines.

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI)
- Practice of frequent merge code changes by developers.
- It is done with a CI server. Devs commit code changes, multiple times per day.
- CI notifies automatically if there's an issue. 
+ Early detection +Eliminate scramble + Frequent releases
+ Continuous testing + Good coding practices

CONTINUOUS DELIVERY & DEPLOYMENT
- CD is the practice of maintain code in a deployment state. The code is always ready to be deployed.
- CDE is the pracice of frequent deploys with small changes to production. 
- Each code version will go by different stages [Auto.build, auto.test, wich will result into an artifact/package]
+ Faster-to-market + Less issues on the deployment process + Lower risk
+ Reliable rollback + More deployments

INFRASTUCTURE AS CODE (IAC)
Manage/provising infrastructure as code and automation
- For code change, config files can be used with automation tools
- Commits can be used to send the files by source control solutions.
- Automation tools to enact changes defined in code/configuration files
+ Consistency - Create/manage resources | Reusability: Make changes on different hosts
+ Scalability: Set new instances in seconds
+ Simplicity and less complexibility 

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
- Maintain and change state of poeces of infrastructure in a constant stable environment
- Allows to mitigate configuration difficulty
+ Saves time +Insight by having the state of all pieces of a large complex infrastructure
+ Maintenance-easier to change while being stable
+ Less configuration drif which keeps standard configurations across all hosts

ORQUESTRATION
- Automation that supports process and workflows (e.g provisioning resources)
+ Scalable - resources can be increased/decreated quickly to match changing needs
+ Stability - Automation tools can auto-respond for fix issues. | Save time - high level management
+ Self-service - Can be served as resource for customer + Granular - insight on how resources are being used

MONOTORING
- Collection & presentation of data regarding performance and stability of services infrastructure
- It can be presented in different forms such as real-time or graphs or both
- Allows to do a postmortem analysis where teams can discuss what went wrong
+ Faster recovering + More visibility for teams
+ Better route cause analysis + Automated response

MICROSERVICES
- Architecture that breaks an application into a collection of small loosely-couple services
- Used for monolithic architectures where they can interact to each other by well defined APIs.
+ Modularity - they are independent of each other but they can communicate between them.
+ Technical flexibility - We can use the best tool for each job
+ Optimize salability

DEVOPS TOOLS
	AUTOMATION
		> Java = Maven, Gradle
		> JS = NPM, Grunt, Gulp
		> Make = used on Linux servers
		> Packer = Build machine images and containers

	CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
		> Jenkings = fork of hudson
		> Travis-ci = github integration
		> Bamboo = not free but integrates with atlasian tools

	CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
		> Ansible = Declarative declaration > Uses YAML config files to manage it.
		> Puppet = managed by UI, creates modules, users control server
		> Chef = Procedural configuration - We write scripts to set environments on the state we want.
		> Salt = Declarative config - Agents(minions) and Server(Master), Events driven for automation

	CONTAINERS & VMS
		> Hypervisor - Runs on metal infrastructure and manages VMs
		> VMWARE, Microsoft Hyper V, Citrix XenServer
		> Docker

	MONOTORING
		> Inffrastrucure monitoring > CPU, RAM, etc
		> App performance > Response time, logs
		> SENSU (infrastructure)
		> New relic (Saas-infrastructure)
		> App dynamic

	ORQUESTRATION
		> Docker swarm
		> Kubernetes
		> Rookkeeper (Apache)
		> Terraform (Intergrates with AWS, Ansible)
